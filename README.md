# What is content aware scale?
"Content Aware Scaling was first introduced in Photoshop CS4 and is used to resize an image while preserving the proportions of important image elements. Normal scaling affects all pixels uniformly when resizing an image but content aware scale attempts to only alter pixels that have little visual content"

This script allows content aware scale to be applied frame by frame over a video, without a need for photoshop.
